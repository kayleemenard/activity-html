    <h1>Thousands of Swamp Things</h1>

    <p>Conventional wisdom tells us there are predominantly two movies out there: 
        <ol>
            <li><em>Swamp Thing</em></li>
            <li><em>The Return Of Swamp Thing</em> (its less popular but still well-known follow-up)</li>
        </ol> 
        What we’re finding, however, is that those two films are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what the art of cinema has to offer.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What does this mean???</h2>
    
    <p>According to the report, most movies aren’t even based on DC Comics superheroes—or on comics at all, for that matter—but exist instead within completely unrelated genres:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Romantic Comedies</li>
        <li>Period Dramas</li>
        <li>Animated Features</li>
        <li>Musicals</li>
        <li>and even Documentaries</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>“As for the quality of these other films, however…” AFI board of trustees chair Howard added. “Well, I really can’t speak to that.”
